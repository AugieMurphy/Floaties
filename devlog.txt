Augie :: <Thing member did.>
Gabi  :: <Thing member did.>
Sasha :: Made a modified flow chart of the driver based on what we discussed in class. Major changes from old flow chart - Driver no longer has thisPlayer, lasPlayer instance vars and no longer has nextPlayer. Modified flow chart has Player[] _player as an instance vars, which allows for Players to take turns during the game.

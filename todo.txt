School Week of 11/9 - 11/13
      1.skeletons of each class:
        **pre and post conditions  + any additional comments
        ** main methods (PRIORITYYYY) - how we should test functionality before we have a     
            complete product. 

      2. Get a devlog going  which we should push to the repo? who made what modifications 
          when 
    END GOAL  - modify our Notes as needed (we should make it as organized as possible) to          
    account for any problems we might have encountered during the creation of the skeletons i.e.  
     a design flaw

Weekend of 11/21-11/22
      1. Human extends Player 
      2. GOFISH! Driver 
      3. Making cards display nicely in the terminal. 
          **In all previous steps, Card Classes and Hand Classes did not fancily display cards but just did, for example, 1CLUB JDIA or something 
          **This would also involve figuring out how playing with more than one person would affect how things are displayed in the terminal
